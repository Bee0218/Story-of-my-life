                    My journey in the world of sports began when I discovered my love for 
                    volleyball four years ago. The moment I touched that ball, I felt an 
                    inexplicable connection. Volleyball became more than just a sport; it 
                    became a way of life. Over the years, I've honed my skills, from perfecting 
                    my serves to mastering those jaw-dropping spikes. Playing on various teams 
                    and participating in tournaments, I've learned the importance of teamwork, 
                    communication, and perseverance.

                    As I delved deeper into the world of volleyball, I had the incredible 
                    opportunity to join the thrilling world of nine-man volleyball. This 
                    unique variation of the sport, rooted in Chinese-American culture, 
                    allowed me to further explore my passion for the game. The fast-paced, 
                    dynamic nature of nine-man volleyball brought new challenges and 
                    excitement to my volleyball journey.

                    Nine-man volleyball is a modified version of traditional indoor 
                    volleyball that is often played informally, particularly in 
                    Asian-American communities and in some parts of the United States.

                    Simultaneously, I embarked on a parallel journey through the Cadets 
                    program. For the past five to six years, I dedicated myself to this 
                    program, rising through the ranks to reach the prestigious position 
                    of Warrant Officer. Cadets taught me invaluable life skills such as 
                    discipline, leadership, and teamwork. I've participated in numerous 
                    activities, honing my abilities to adapt to challenging situations and 
                    take charge when needed.
